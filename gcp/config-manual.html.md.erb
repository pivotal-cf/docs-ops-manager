This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director in <%= vars.ops_manager %> on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. For more information, see <a href="../install/ops-man-api.html">Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API</a>.</p>


## <a id='access-om'></a> Step 1: Log Into <%= vars.ops_manager %>

To configure BOSH Director, you must first access your <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation and determine how your user database is maintained.

To access <%= vars.ops_manager %>:

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of <%= vars.ops_manager %> that you set up in [Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP](./deploy-manual.html).
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In order to set up <%= vars.ops_manager %> authentication correctly, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends using an FQDN to access <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Using an ephemeral IP address to access <%= vars.ops_manager %> can cause authentication errors upon subsequent access.</p>

1. Log into <%= vars.ops_manager %>. To log in, see [Log In to <%= vars.ops_manager %> For the First Time](../login.html#login-first-time).

## <a id='gcp-config'></a> Step 2: Configure GCP Tile

To configure your GCP tile:

1. Click the **Google Cloud Platform** tile in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. Select **Google Config** and complete the following fields:
    * **Project ID**: Enter your GCP project ID in lowercase, such as: `your-gcp-project-id`.
    * **Default Deployment Tag**: Enter the prefix that you used when creating the GCP resources for this <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation.
    * Select **AuthJSON**. In the field below, enter the contents of the JSON file that you downloaded in [Set Up IAM Service Accounts](prepare-env-manual.html#iam_account) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP_.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> As an alternative, you can select <strong>The <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM Service Account</strong> option to use the service account that you set up in <a href="prepare-env-manual.html#iam_account">Set Up IAM Service Accounts</a> in <em>Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP</em>. To use this option, the service account must be assigned the <strong>Service Account Actor</strong> role.</p>
       <%= image_tag("../common/images/gcp/google_config.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'Google Cloud Platform Config', underneath which is a horizonal line. Below the line are two text fields: one labeled 'Project ID' with a red asterisk to denote that it is a required field, and another labeled 'Default Deployment Tag'. Below this are two options: one selected radio button labeled 'The Ops Manager VM Service Account', and another button labeled 'AuthJSON'. Underneath 'AuthJSON' is a blank text area. At the bottom of the image is a blue, rectangular button labeled 'Save'.") %>
1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='director-config'></a> Step 3: Configure Director

To configure the **Director Config** pane in the BOSH Director tile, you must have the correct permissions. To configure these permissions, see [Required Permissions](https://bosh.io/docs/google-required-permissions/) in the BOSH documentation and [Creating storage buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) in the GCP documentation.

<%= partial "../common/director-config" %>

## <a id='az'></a> Step 4: Configure Create Availability Zones

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <%= vars.company_name %> recommends at least three availability zones (AZs) for a highly available installation.
  <ul>
    <li>For configuring a <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment with multiple AZs, see <a href="../refarch/gcp/gcp_ref_arch.html">Reference Architecture for <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP</a>.</li>
    <li>For <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> best practices for distributing workloads across multiple AZs and clusters, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/maintain-uptime.html">Maintaining Workload Uptime</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

To configure the **Create Availability Zones** pane:

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.

1. Click **Add**.

1. For **Google Availability Zone**:
    * Enter one of the zones that you associated to the back end service instance groups of the HTTP(S) load balancer. For example, if you are using the `us-central1` region and selected `us-central1-a` as one of the zones for your HTTP(S) load balancer instance groups, enter `us-central1-a`.
    * Click **Add**.
    * Repeat the above step for all the AZs that you associated to instance groups in [Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP](./prepare-env-manual.html#create-http-and-instance-group).
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/gcp/availability_zones_multiple.png", :alt => "") %>
    * Click **Save**.

1. Repeat the above step for all the AZs you are using in your deployment. When you are done, click **Save**.


## <a id='network'></a> Step 5: Configure Create Networks

To configure the **Create Networks** pane:

1. Select **Create Networks**.

1. Make sure **Enable ICMP checks** is not selected. GCP routers do not respond to ICMP pings.

1. Click **Add Network**. Create the three networks described in the tables below.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To use a shared VPC network, enter the shared VPC host project name before the network name in the format <code>VPC-PROJECT-NAME/NETWORK-NAME/SUBNET-NAME/REGION-NAME</code>. For example, <code>vpc-project/opsmgr/central/us-central1</code>. For more information, see <a href="../install/gcp-shared-vpc.html">Configuring a Shared VPC on GCP</a>.</p>

## <a id="assign-azs"></a> Step 6: Configure Assign AZs and Networks

To configure the **Assign AZs and Networks** pane:

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/assign-az.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'Assign AZs and Networks' with a horizontal line underneath. Below the line are the words 'The BOSH Director is a single instance. Choose the availability zone in which to place that instance. It is highly recommended that you backup this VM on a regular basis to preserve settings.' Below this text is a dropdown labeled 'Singleton Availability Zone', with 'AZ-MGMT' selected. Below this is another dropdown labeled 'Network', with 'Infrastructure' selected.") %>

1. Use the dropdown to select a **Singleton Availability Zone**. The BOSH Director installs in this AZ.

1. Under **Network**, select the `infrastructure` network for your BOSH Director.

1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='security'></a> Step 7: Configure Security

To configure the **Security** pane:

<%= partial "../common/security-pane" %>

## <a id="bosh-dns"></a> Step 8: Configure BOSH DNS Config

<%= partial '../common/bosh-dns-config'  %>

## <a id='syslog'></a> Step 9: Configure Syslog

<%= partial(:"/pcf/ops-manager/syslog_bosh", :locals => { :syslog_context => 'BOSH Director' }) %>

## <a id='resource-config'></a> Step 10: Configure Resources

In the **Resource Config** pane, you must associate load balancers with the VMs in your deployment to enable traffic.

To configure the **Resource Config** pane:

1. Select **Resource Config**.
    <%= image_tag("../common/images/gcp/om_resource_config.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'Resource Config'. In the top right corner of the image is a blue, rectangular button labeled 'Save'. Below the header are four columns labeled, from left to right, 'Job', 'Instances', 'VM Type', and 'Persistent Disk Type'. Under 'Job' are rows labeled with the names of two VMs, 'BOSH Director' and 'Main Compilation Job'. The 'Main Compilation Job' row is expanded, which reveals a 'Load Balancers' field and an 'Internet Connected' checkbox. The 'Load Balancers' field is blank and the 'Internet Connected' checkbox is selected. Under 'Instances' are two dropdowns, with 'Automatic: 1' for BOSH Director and '1' for Main Compilation Job selected. Under 'VM Type' are two dropdowns, with 'Automatic: large.disk (cpu: 2...' selected for BOSH Director and 'small (cpu: 1, ram: 2 GB, disk...' selected for Main Compilation Job. Under 'Persistent Disk Type' is one dropdown with 'Automatic: 50 GB' selected for BOSH Director and the word 'None' for Main Compilation Job.") %>

1. To add a load balancer to the BOSH Director, select the icon next to the **BOSH Director** job name to see the **Load Balancers** field and **Internet Connected** checkbox. Ensure that the **Internet Connected** checkbox is not selected for any job. The checkbox gives VMs a public IP address that enables outbound internet access. In [Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP](./prepare-env-manual.html), you provisioned a Network Address Translation (NAT) box to provide internet connectivity to your VMs. For more information about using NAT in GCP, see [VPC network overview](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking) in the GCP documentation.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you install <%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>), provision your <strong>Main Compilation Job</strong> with at least 100&nbsp;GB of disk space.</p>


## <a id="custom-vm-extensions"></a> Step 11: (Optional) Add Custom VM Extensions

<%= partial "../common/vm-extension-config"  %>

## <a id='complete'></a> Step 12: Complete the BOSH Director Installation

To complete your BOSH Director installation:

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**. If the following ICMP error message appears, return to the **Network Config** pane, and ensure you have deselected the **Enable ICMP Checks** checkbox. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** again.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/cloudform/install-error.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the rectangular, dark green Ops Manager header, with a teal square containing a capital P on the far left, the words 'Pivotal Ops Manager' to the right of the square, and the words 'pivotal-cf' beside a downward-pointing carat on the far right. Below the header is an error message with a red background. To the left on the error message is a red triangle containing an exclamation point beside the words 'Please review the errors below'. Below 'Please review the errors below' is a bullet list with two items: 'Cannot reach gateway with IP 10.0.16.1 (ignorable if ICMP is deactivated)' and 'Cannot reach DNS with IP 10.0.0.2 (ignorable if ICMP is deactivated)'. To the right of this list are two buttons: a white, rectangular button labeled 'Ignore errors and start the install' in red letters on the left, and a red, rectangular button labeled 'Stop and fix errors' in white letters on the right.") %>

1. BOSH Director installs. This might take a few moments. When the installation process successfully completes, the **Changes Applied** window appears.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/cloudform/ops-manager-complete.png", :alt => "A pop-up window with a round, gray X button in the upper-right corner and the words 'Changed Applied' next to a round, green circle containing a checkmark. Below 'Changed Applied' are the words 'Ops Manager Director was successfully installed. We recommend that you export a backup of this installation from the actions menu.' Below this text and to the right of the pop-up window are a gray, rectangular button labeled 'Close' next to a blue, rectangular button labeled 'Return to Installation Dashboard'.") %>


## <a id="next"></a> Next Steps
