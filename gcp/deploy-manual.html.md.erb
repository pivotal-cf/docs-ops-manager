This topic describes how you can deploy <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Before you deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %>, see the preparation steps in [Preparing to deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP](prepare-env-manual.html).

After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in [Configuring BOSH Director on GCP](config-manual.html).

## <a id='select-tgz'></a> Step 1: Locate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation file

1. Log in to [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/ops-manager/).

1. From the **Releases** drop-down menu, select the release for your to installation.

1. Select one of the following download files:
    * **<%= vars.ops_manager %> for GCP**
    * **<%= vars.ops_manager %> YAML for GCP**

    When you click the download link, your browser downloads or opens the <code>OpsManager_VERSION_onGCP.pdf</code> or <code>OpsManager_VERSION_onGCP.yml</code> file. <br/><br/>
   These documents provide the GCP location of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> `.tar.gz` installation file based on the geographic location of your installation.

1. Copy the filepath string of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> image based on your deployment location.

## <a id='create-image'></a> Step 2: Create a private VM image

1. Log in to the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

1. In the navigation panel, click **Compute Engine**, then click **Images**.

1. Click **Create Image**.

1. Complete the following text boxes:

    * **Name**: Enter a name. For example, `om-pcf`.
    * **Encryption**: Leave **Automatic (recommended)** selected.
    * **Source**: Choose **Cloud Storage file**.
    * **Cloud Storage file**: Paste in the Google Cloud Storage filepath you copied from the PDF file in the [previous step](#select-tgz).

1. Click **Create**. The file might take a few minutes to import.

## <a id='start-vm'></a> Step 3: Create the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance

1. Select the check box for the image that you previously created.

1. Click **Create Instance**.

2. In the **Create an instance form**, complete the following text boxes:

    * **Name**: Enter a name that matches the naming conventions of your deployment.
    * **Zone**: Choose a zone from the region in which you created your network.
    * **Machine type**: Choose `n1-standard-2`.
        * Click **Customize** to manually configure the vCPU and memory. An <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM instance requires the following minimum specifications:

            | **Machine Spec** | **Minimum Value** |
            |------------------|-------------------|
            | CPU              | 2&nbsp;vCPUs      |
            | Memory           | 8&nbsp;GB         |

    * **Boot disk**: Click **Change**, then perform the following steps:
        * Click **Custom images** if it is not already selected.
        * Click **Boot disk type**. If your environment has high performance needs, click **SSD**. As an example, environments used to
        [develop <%= vars.ops_manager %> tiles](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tile-Developer-Guide/3.0/tile-dev-guide/index.html) might benefit from a higher performing <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM boot disk. For most environments, you can select **Standard**.
        * Set the **Size (GB)** of the boot disk to the minimum or higher.

            | **Machine Spec** | **Minimum Value** |
            |------------------|-------------------|
            | Boot disk        | 100&nbsp;GB       |

        * Select the <%= vars.ops_manager %> image you created in the previous step if it is not already selected.

        * Click **Select** to save.

    * Under **Identity and API access**, select the **Service account** you created when preparing your environment during the step [Set up IAM Service Accounts](prepare-env-manual.html#iam_account).
    * **Allow HTTP traffic**: Leave this check box deselected.
    * **Allow HTTPS traffic**: Leave this check box deselected.
    * **Networking**: Select the **Networking** tab, and perform the following steps:
        * Under **Network interfaces**, perform the following steps:
            * Remove the `default` network interface if this interface still exists.
            * Select the network you created when preparing your environment in [Create a GCP Network with Subnet](prepare-env-manual.html#create_network) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP_. For example, `pcf-virt-net`.
            * Under **Subnetwork**, select the `pcf-infrastructure-subnet-GCP-REGION` subnet that you created when preparing your environment in [Create a GCP Network with Subnet](prepare-env-manual.html#create_network) in _Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP_.
            * For **Primary internal IP**, select **Ephemeral (Custom)**. Enter an IP address (for example, `192.168.101.5`) in the **Custom ephemeral IP address** field. Specify the next available internal IP address located within the reserved IP range that you [configure later in BOSH Director](config-manual.html#network). Do not use the **Gateway IP**, for example `192.168.101.1`.
            * For **External IP**, select **Create IP address**. In the next form, enter a name for the static IP. For example, `om-public-ip`. Click **Reserve**. In the **External IP** drop-down menu, select the static IP address you just reserved.
        * For **Network tags**, enter `pcf-opsman` and `allow-https`. These tags apply the firewall rules you created in [Create Firewall Rules for the Network](prepare-env-manual.html#firewall_rules) to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.

3. Click **Create** to deploy the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM. This might take a few moments.

4. Go to your DNS provider, and create an entry that points a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) `opsman.MY-DOMAIN` to the `pcf-opsman` static IP address of <%= vars.ops_manager %> that you created in a previous step.

    <p> In order to set up <%= vars.ops_manager %> authentication correctly, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends using an FQDN to access <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Using an ephemeral IP address to access <%= vars.ops_manager %> can cause authentication errors upon subsequent access.</p>

After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in [Configuring BOSH Director on GCP](config-manual.html).

Later on, if you need to SSH into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM to perform diagnostic troubleshooting, see [Log Into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM](../install/ssh-login.html#ssh-by-iaas).
