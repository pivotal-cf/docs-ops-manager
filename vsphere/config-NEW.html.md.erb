## <a id='dir-config'></a>Step 3: Configure BOSH Director

1. Select **Director Config**.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-06.png") %>

1. In the **NTP Servers (comma delimited)** field, enter your NTP server addresses.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The NTP server configuration only updates
    after VM recreation. Ensure that you select the <strong>Recreate all VMs</strong> checkbox
    if you modify the value of this field.</p>

1. Leave the **JMX Provider IP Address** field blank.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Starting from PCF v2.0, BOSH-reported system metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default.</p>
1. Leave the **Bosh HM Forwarder IP Address** field blank.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Starting from PCF v2.0, BOSH-reported component metrics are available in the Loggregator Firehose by default.</p>

    * **Username**: Enter the username for your email server.
    * **Password**: Enter the password for your email server.
    * **Enable TLS**: Select this checkbox to enable Transport Layer Security.
1. Select a **Blobstore Location** to either configure the blobstore as an internal server or an external endpoint. Because the internal server is unscalable and less secure, Pivotal recommends you configure an external blobstore.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: After you deploy Ops Manager, you cannot change the blobstore location.</p>
  * **Internal**: Select this option to use an internal blobstore. Ops Manager creates a new VM for blob storage. No additional configuration is required.
  * **S3 Compatible Blobstore**: Select this option to use an external S3-compatible endpoint. Follow the procedures in [Sign up for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/SigningUpforS3.html) and [Create a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) in the AWS documentation. When you have created an S3 bucket, complete the following steps:
      1. **S3 Endpoint**: Navigate to the [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) topic in the AWS documentation. Locate the endpoint for your region in the **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** table and construct a URL using your region's endpoint. For example, if you are using the `us-west-2` region, the URL you create would be https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com. Enter this URL into the **S3 Endpoint** field in Ops Manager.
      1. **Bucket Name**: Enter the name of the S3 bucket.
      1. **Access Key** and **Secret Key**: Enter the keys you generated when creating your S3 bucket.
      1. Select **V2 Signature** or **V4 Signature**. If you select **V4 Signature**, enter your **Region**.
        <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: AWS recommends using Signature Version 4. For more information about AWS S3 Signatures, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests</a> in the AWS documentation.</p>
  * **GCS Blobstore**: Select this option to use an external Google Cloud Storage (GCS) endpoint. To create a GCS bucket, you will need a GCS account. Follow the procedures in [Creating Storage Buckets](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets) in the GCP documentation. Once you have created a GCS bucket, complete the following steps:
        1. **Bucket Name**: Enter the name of your GCS bucket.
        1. **Storage Class**: Select the storage class for your GCS bucket. For more information, see [Storage Classes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes) in the GCP documentation.
        1. **Service Account Key**: Follow the steps in the [Set up an IAM Service Account](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf/om/2-2/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#iam_account) section of _Preparing to Deploy PCF on GCP_ to download a JSON file with a private key, and then enter the contents of the JSON file into the field.

        <%= image_tag("gcp/blobstore.png") %>

1. By default, PCF deploys and manages an **Internal** database for you. If you choose to use an **External MySQL Database**, complete the associated fields with information obtained from your external MySQL Database provider: **Host**, **Port**, **Username**, **Password**, and **Database**.

    <%= image_tag("director-database.png") %>

1. (Optional) **Director Workers** sets the number of workers available to execute Director tasks. This field defaults to `5`.
1. (Optional) **Max Threads** sets the maximum number of threads that the BOSH Director can run simultaneously. For vSphere, the default value is `32`. Leave the field blank to use this default value. Pivotal recommends that you use the default value unless doing so results in rate limiting or errors on your IaaS.
1. (Optional) To add a custom URL for your BOSH Director, enter a valid hostname in **Director Hostname**. You can also use this field to configure a load balancer in front of your BOSH Director. For more information, see [How to Set Up a Load Balancer in Front of Operations Manager Director](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-Set-Up-a-Load-Balancer-in-Front-of-Ops-Manager-Director) in Pivotal Support.<br/>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>:
    In Ops Manager v2.3.2 and earlier, if you change the <b>Director Hostname</b> after your initial deployment, VMs become unavailable. This causes PCF downtime. To restore VM availability, enable <b>Recreate All VMs</b> and redeploy. This issue is resolved in Ops Manager v2.3.3 and later.
    </p>
1. (Optional) To set a custom banner that users see when logging in to the Director using SSH, enter text in the **Custom SSH Banner** field.
  <%= image_tag("disable-bosh-dns.png") %>
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='create-az'></a>Step 4: Create Availability Zones
Ops Manager Availability Zones (AZs) correspond to your vCenter clusters and resource pools. Multiple AZs allow you to provide high availability and load balancing to your applications. When you run more than one instance of an application, Ops Manager balances those instances across all of the AZs assigned to the application. At least three AZs are recommended for a highly available installation of your chosen runtime.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For more information about using AZs in vSphere, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/understand-az.html">Understanding Availability Zones in VMware Installations</a> in the PCF documentation.</p>

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-08.png") %>

1. Use the following steps to create one or more AZs for PKS to use:
    * Click **Add** and create the PKS Management AZ.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the AZ, such as `AZ-MGMT`.
    * Select the IaaS configuration, `vSphere` or `vCenter`.
    * Enter the name of an existing vCenter **Cluster** to use as an AZ, such as `COMP-Cluster-1`.
    * Enter the name of the PKS Management **Resource Pool** in the vCenter cluster that you specified above, such as `RP-MGMT-PKS`. The jobs running in this AZ share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    * Click **Add Cluster** and create at least one PKS Compute AZ.
    * Specify the **Cluster** and the **Resource Pool**, such as `RP-PKS-AZ`.
    * Add additional clusters as necessary. Click the trash icon to delete a cluster. The first cluster cannot be deleted.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-11.png") %>

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-13.png") %>

1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("images/nsxt/bosh/config-bosh-12.png") %>

## <a id='create-networks'></a>Step 5: Create Networks Page

1. Select **Create Networks**.
  <p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you use the Cisco Nexus
1000v Switch, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/nexus-switch.html">Using the Cisco Nexus 1000v Switch with Ops Manager</a> in the PCF documentation for more information.</p>

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. The BOSH Director uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.

1. Click **Add Network** and create the following networks:
  * `pks-infrastructure`: This network is for Ops Manager, the BOSH Director, the PKS broker, and the PKS API.
  * `pks-main`: If you have a large deployment with multiple tiles, you can choose to deploy the PKS broker and PKS API to a separate network named `pks-main`. See the table below for more information.
  * `pks-services`: Network for creating the master and worker VMs for Kubernetes clusters. The CIDR should not conflict with the pod overlay network `10.200.0.0/16` or the reserved Kubernetes services CIDR of `10.100.200.0/24`.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Multiple networks allow you to place vCenter on a private network and the rest of your deployment on a public network. Isolating vCenter in this manner denies access to it from outside sources and reduces possible security vulnerabilities.</p>
  Use the values from the following table as a guide when you create each network, replacing the IP addresses with ranges that are available in your vSphere environment:
