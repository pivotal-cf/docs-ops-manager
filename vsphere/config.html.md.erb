This topic describes how you can configure the BOSH Director tile for VMware vSphere.

You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. For more information, see [Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API](../install/ops-man-api.html).

<p> If you are installing <%= vars.k8s_runtime_first %> on vSphere with NSX-T integration, follow the
instructions in <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated-Edition/1.17/tkgi/GUID-vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html">Configuring BOSH Director with NSX-T for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %></a> instead of
performing the procedure described in this topic.</p>

After you complete this procedure, follow the configuration instructions for the runtime that you choose to install:

* To install <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>,
see the [<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/configure-pas.html).

* To install <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>,
see the [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/pas-vsphere-requirements.html).

For more information about <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> runtimes,
see [Installing Runtimes](../install/runtimes.html).

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisite

Before you begin this procedure, you must complete all steps in [Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> to vSphere](deploy.html).

## <a id='set-up'></a> Step 1: Log into <%= vars.ops_manager %>

1. In a web browser, go to the fully qualified domain of your <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

1. Log in to <%= vars.ops_manager %>. To log in, see [Log In to <%= vars.ops_manager %> for the first time](../login.html#login-first-time).

## <a id='vcenter-config'></a> Step 2: Configure vCenter

1. Click the **BOSH Director for vSphere** tile.

1. Click **vCenter Config**. Configure the one or more vCenters that host your <%= vars.ops_manager %> foundation, as described in the following steps.

    ![alt-text=""](../common/images/vcenter-config.png)

1. Complete the following fields on the **vCenter Config** pane:
    * **Name**: A name that you provide for your vCenter configuration. This field is used to identify the datacenter configuration in <%= vars.ops_manager %> if you are configuring multiple datacenters.
    * **vCenter Host**: The hostname of the vCenter that manages ESXi/vSphere.
    * **vCenter Username**: A vCenter username with create and delete privileges for virtual machines (VMs) and folders.
    * **vCenter Password**: The password for the vCenter user specified earlier.
    * **vCenter CA Certificate**: The CA certificate or certificate chain that signs the TLS certificate for the vCenter host. When provided, TLS connections to the vCenter server will validate its certificate is trusted. When left blank, TLS connections will be established but the certificate will not be validated.
    * **Datacenter Name**: The name of the datacenter as it appears in vCenter.
    * **Virtual Disk Type**: The Virtual Disk Type to provision for all VMs. For guidance on
    selecting a virtual disk type, see [vSphere virtual disk types](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/4.0/tas-for-vms/disk-format.html).

        <p> Datastores do not support whitespace characters in their names. Including whitespace characters in datastore names causes an error.</p>

    * **Ephemeral Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store ephemeral VM disks deployed by <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
    * **Ephemeral Datastore Cluster Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastore clusters that store ephemeral VM disks deployed by <%= vars.ops_manager %>. If Datastore Names and Datastore Clusters are specified, both are considered for disk placement. If you deactivate Storage DRS for a datastore cluster, the BOSH CPI ignores the cluster.
    For more information, see [Activate and deactivate storage DRS](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.resmgmt.doc/GUID-827DBD6D-08B7-4411-9214-9E126671457F.html). As of <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0.11+LTS-T, datastore clusters located in folders can be referenced using the full path to the datastore cluster. Folder names must be followed by a forward slash character.
    * **Persistent Datastore Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastores that store persistent VM disks deployed by <%= vars.ops_manager %>.
    * **Persistent Datastore Cluster Names (comma delimited)**: The names of the datastore clusters that store persistent VM disks deployed by <%= vars.ops_manager %>. If Datastore Names and Datastore Clusters are specified, both are considered for disk placement. If you deactivate Storage DRS for a datastore cluster, the BOSH CPI ignores the cluster.
    For more information, see [Activate and deactivate storage DRS](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.resmgmt.doc/GUID-827DBD6D-08B7-4411-9214-9E126671457F.html). As of <%= vars.ops_manager %> v3.0.11+LTS-T, datastore clusters located in folders can be referenced using the full path to the datastore cluster. Folder names must be followed by a forward slash character.

        <p> A datastore cluster is a collection of datastores with shared resources and a shared management interface.</p>

1. To configure networking, complete the **vCenter Config** fields described:

    * **Standard vCenter Networking:** This is the default option when upgrading <%= vars.ops_manager %>. If you select this option, you do not need to configure the **NSX-T Networking** fields.

        <p> If you intend to deploy <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> using Flannel as the CNI, select this option to configure the BOSH Director. Do not choose <strong>NSX-T Networking</strong>. When you configure the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> tile later on, you configure Flannel as the container network interface (CNI).<br><br>If you intend to deploy <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> with NSX-T, see the <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated-Edition/1.16/tkgi/GUID-vsphere-nsxt-index.html"><%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> documentation</a>.</p>

        <p> When deploying on VMC (vSphere on AWS), you must select <strong>Standard vCenter Networking</strong>. <strong>NSX-T Networking</strong> does not work with VMC.</p>

    * **NSX-T Networking:** Select this option to allow NSX-T network virtualization for non-<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> products such as <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. This virtualization allows you to configure component load balancing and security in the **Resource Config** pane of the BOSH Director tile.
    For more information, see [Step 10: Resource Config pane](#resource-config).<br><br>Configure NSX networking by entering the following information:

        * **Use NSX-T Policy API**: Select whether to use the NSX-T Policy API instead of the Manager API when placing VMs in NSX-T groups and server pools. You can use NSX-T groups or server pools to designate VMs as load balancer back ends. This feature requires NSX-T Data Center v3.0 or later.
        * **Use NSX-T Policy API Migration Mode**: Activate this check box to activate migration mode on the CPI. This allows you to transition infrastructure created with the Management API over to the Policy API.
        * **NSX Address**: The address of the NSX Manager.
        * **NSX-T Authentication**: Select how BOSH Director authenticates to the NSX Manager:
            * **Local User Authentication** authenticates with a username and password.
                * For this option, fill in the **NSX Username** and **NSX Password** fields. Specify an NSX user with `Enterprise Administrator` privileges.
            * **Certificate Authentication** authenticates with a certificate and private key.
                * For this option, fill in the **NSX Manager Principal Identity Certificate** and **NSX Manager Principal Identity Private Key** fields.
        * **NSX CA Cert**: A CA certificate in PEM format that establishes a secure connection to the NSX server before the BOSH Director authenticates to the NSX Manager.
        If the NSX Manager generated a self-signed certificate, use the following command to retrieve the CA certificate using OpenSSL:

            ```
            openssl s_client -showcerts -connect NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS:443 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | openssl x509
            ```

            Where `NSX-MANAGER-ADDRESS` is the address of the NSX manager.

        * **Use NSX-T Policy API Migration Mode**: This is a special mode to migrate an existing deployment from earlier NSX-T Manager API objects such as NS Groups to the newer NSX-T Policy API objects such as Groups, and must only be used with NSX-T migration scripts. Leave unchecked if unsure.

1. Configure the following folder names:
    * **VM Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder where <%= vars.ops_manager %> places VMs. Enter `[YOUR-DEPLOYMENT]_vms` where `YOUR-DEPLOYMENT` corresponds to a descriptive name for your deployment. For example, `my_pcf_vms`.
    * **Template Folder**: The vSphere datacenter folder where <%= vars.ops_manager %> places templates. Enter `[YOUR-DEPLOYMENT]_templates`. For example, `my_pcf_templates`.
    * **Disk path Folder**: The vSphere datastore folder where <%= vars.ops_manager %> creates attached disk images. You must not nest this folder. Enter `[YOUR-DEPLOYMENT]_disk`. For example, `my_pcf_disk`.

    <p> After initial deployment, you cannot edit folder names.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. (Optional) Click **Add vCenter Config** toward the top of the form to configure additional vCenters. Once you click **Save**, your multiple vCenter Configs are listed in the **vCenter Configs** pane. For more information about multiple vCenter configs, see [Managing multiple data centers](../install/multiple-datacenters.html).

## <a id='dir-config'></a> Step 3: Director Config pane

<%= partial "../common/director-config" %>

## <a id='create-az'></a> Step 4: Create Availability Zones pane

<%= vars.ops_manager %> Availability Zones (AZs) correspond to your vCenter clusters, resource pools or host groups.

Multiple AZs allow you to provide high availability and load balancing to your applications. When you run more than one instance of an application, <%= vars.ops_manager %> balances those instances across all of the AZs assigned to the application.

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you use at least three AZs for a highly available installation of your chosen runtime.

<p> For more information about AZs and high availability in vSphere,
see <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Operations-Manager/3.0/vmware-tanzu-ops-manager/install-understand-az.html">Compute and HA considerations</a> in <em>vSphere Reference architecture</em>.</p>

1. Select **Create Availability Zones**.

    ![alt-text=""](../common/images/create-az.png)

1. Use the following steps to create the first AZ.
    * Click **Add**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the AZ.
    * Select a vCenter config name from the **IaaS Configuration** drop-down menu to associate your AZ with a vCenter. If you have only one vCenter config, or if you are creating your first AZ, IaaS Configuration defaults to the first vCenter and cannot be configured.
    * Enter the name of the vCenter **Cluster** where you deployed <%= vars.ops_manager %>. You created this cluster in the [Prepare vSphere](deploy.html#prepare-vsphere) step of _Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> to vSphere_. For example, `Cluster1`.
    * Enter the name of the **Resource Pool** that you created in the [Prepare vSphere](deploy.html#prepare-vsphere) step of _Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> to vSphere_ to organize management components like BOSH Director.
    For example, `RP-MGMT`. The jobs running in this AZ share the CPU and memory resources defined by the pool.
    You only need to specify this resource group in one AZ.
    * (Optional) Enter the name of a **Host Group** for the AZ to use. The host group must be within the cluster you designated in the **Clusters** field. You created host groups in the [Prepare vSphere](deploy.html#prepare-vsphere) step of _Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> to vSphere_.
    For more information about using host groups, see [Host groups in vSphere](host-groups.html).
    * (Optional) In the **VM-Host Affinity Rule** drop-down menu, select **SHOULD**. Selecting **SHOULD** allows vSphere to restart VMs in another host group in the event of an AZ failure. For more information, see [DRS host-affinity rules and stretched clusters](host-groups.html#host-affinity-rule) in _Host Groups in vSphere_.
      <p> The value for <strong>VM-Host Affinity Rule</strong> only applies if you are using Host Groups. If you do not specify a <strong>Host Group</strong> for the cluster, then any changes you make to <strong>VM-Host Affinity Rule</strong> are ignored.</p></p>
    * (Optional) Click **Add Cluster** to add more clusters to the AZ as required by your installation size and high availability requirements.

1. (Optional) Use the following steps to create additional AZs.
    * Click **Add**.
    * Specify **Cluster** and optionally, a **Resource Pool** or a **Host Group** with a **VM-Host Affinity Rule**. Typically you specify either a resource pool or a host group for an AZ, but not both. For more information about the difference between host groups and resource pools, see [Host Groups in vSphere](host-groups.html).
    * Click **Add Cluster** to assign more clusters to the AZ as necessary for high availability. Click the trash icon to delete a cluster. The first cluster cannot be deleted.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='create-networks'></a> Step 5: Create Networks pane

1. Select **Create Networks**.

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. <%= vars.ops_manager %> uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable.

1. Depending on the runtime that you are deploying, do one of the following:

    * For <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, click **Add Network** and create the following networks:
        * `infrastructure`: This network is for <%= vars.ops_manager %> and the BOSH Director.
        * `pas`: This network is for all the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> VMs including GoRouter, Diego cells, and Cloud Controller.
        * `services`: This network is for any service tiles to be deployed alongside <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.<br><br> Use the values from the following table as a guide when you create each network,
        replacing the IP addresses with ranges that are available in your vSphere environment:

    * For <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, click **Add Network** and create the following networks:
        * `infrastructure`: This network is for <%= vars.ops_manager %>, the BOSH Director, the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> broker, and the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API.
        * `pks`: If you have a large deployment with multiple tiles, you can choose to deploy the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> broker and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> API to a separate network named `pks`. For more information, see the following table for more information.
        * `services`: Network for creating the primary and worker VMs for Kubernetes clusters. The CIDR  cannot conflict with the pod overlay network `10.200.0.0/16` or the reserved Kubernetes services CIDR of `10.100.200.0/24`.

            <sup id="note1">&#42;</sup> In **vSphere Network Name**, enter the full path of the network as it displays in vCenter. For example, enter `YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME/YOUR-NETWORK-NAME`. If your vSphere Network Name contains a forward slash character, replace the forward slash with the URL-encoded forward slash character `%2f`.<br>

            <sup id="note2">&#8224;</sup> For **Reserved IP Ranges**, enter any IP addresses from the **CIDR** that you do not want BOSH to use in your installation. <%= vars.ops_manager %> does not deploy VMs to any address in this range.

1. For each network that you create, select the **Availability Zones** to use with the network. Assign as many AZs to your network as needed by your deployment. For more information, see <a href="..//refarch/vsphere/vsphere_ref_arch.html#high-availability">Compute and HA considerations</a> and <a href="../refarch/vsphere/vsphere_ref_arch.html#scaling">Scaling and Capacity Managment</a> sections of the vSphere Reference Architecture.

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id='assign-azs'></a> Step 6: Assign AZs and Networks

1. Select **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Use the **Singleton Availability Zone** drop-down menu to select a singleton AZ. The BOSH Director is installed as a single instance in this Availability Zone.

1. Use the **Network** drop-down menu to select a network for your BOSH Director.

## <a id='syslog'></a> Step 9: Syslog pane

<p> BOSH Director logs contain sensitive information that can be considered privileged. For example, these logs might contain cloud provider credentials. If you choose to forward logs to an external syslog endpoint, use TLS encryption to prevent information from being intercepted by a third party.</p>

## <a id='resource-config'></a> Step 10: Resource Config pane

1. Click **Resource Config**.

    ![alt-text=""](../common/images/vsphere-om-resources.png)

1. Under the **Instances**, **VM Type**, and **Persistent Disk Type** fields, choose **Automatic** from the drop-down menus to allocate the recommended resources for the job.

1. If the **Persistent Disk Type** field displays the value **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.

    <p> For the BOSH Director job, select a VM type with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>
    <p> If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, <%= vars.ops_manager %> automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>
    <p> If you install <%= vars.windows_runtime_first %>, provision your <strong>Main Compilation Job</strong> with at least 100&nbsp;GB of disk space.</p>

1. (Optional) If you configured NSX-T networking in the **vCenter Config** pane, and you want to configure security and load balancing for the BOSH Director job:
  1. Click the menu expansion icon next to the **BOSH Director** job name. The **NSX-T Configuration** configuration fields appear.
  2. Enter your NSX-T configuration values in these fields.

1. Click **Save**.
