<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic provides instructions for deploying Ops Manager to VMware vSphere.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The instructions in this topic are based on vSphere 6.5 using the vSphere Client (HTML5) interface.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you are installing Pivotal Container Service (PKS)
on vSphere with NSX-T integration, follow the instructions in
<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-3/vsphere-nsxt-om-deploy.html">Deploying Ops Manager with NSX-T for PKS</a>
instead of performing the steps described in this topic.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: For security purposes, VMware requires a dedicated instance of Ops Manager for use with PKS. Do not deploy Pivotal Application Service (PAS) on the same instance of Ops Manager as PKS. For more information, see <a href="pas-and-pks.html">PAS and PKS Deployments with Ops Manager</a>.</p>

## <a id="deploy"></a> Prepare vSphere

1. Log into vCenter using the vSphere Client (HTML5).

1. Select the vSphere Datacenter where you are deploying Ops Manager.

1. Create a vSphere cluster.

	A vSphere cluster is a collection of ESXi hosts and associated virtual machines (VMs) with shared resources and a shared management interface.

	To create a vSphere cluster for PKS:

	* Right-click the vSphere Datacenter object.
	* Select **New Cluster**.
	* Name the Cluster.
	* Turn ON DRS
	* Turn ON vSphere HA

1. Create a resource pool.

	Resource pools are vSphere objects used to organize resources. If you are deploying Ops Manager for use with PKS, it is recommended that you create a resource pool for the PKS Management Plane, which includes Ops Manager, BOSH Director, the PKS control plane, and Harbor (optional). Refer to the PKS documentation for details.

	To create a vSphere resource pool:

	* Right-click the vSphere cluster object you created.
	* Select **New Resource Pool**.
	* Name the resource pool.
	* Review the default CPU and Memory settings and adjust if necessary (not common).
	* Click OK.

## <a id="deploy"></a> Deploy Ops Manager

1. Download [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) Ops Manager for vSphere from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io). Use the dropdown menu to select the supported Ops Manager release.

	Ops Manager for vSphere is provided as an OVA file. An OVA file is a template for a virtual machine (VM). To deploy Ops Manager on vSphere, you import the OVA file into your vSphere environment.

1. Right-click the resource pool you created and select **Deploy OVF Template**, or from the vCenter menu select **Actions** > **Deploy OVF Template**.

1. At the **Select an OVF template** screen, click **Browse**.

1. Select the Ops Manager OVA file you downloaded and click **Open**.

1. Review template selection and click **Next**.

1. At the **Select a name and folder** screen: 

	* Enter a name for the Ops Manager virtual machine, or use the default name.
	* Select the **Datacenter** object.
	* Click **Next**.

1. At the **Select Storage** screen, select the virtual disk format.

	* Select **Thin Provision**
	* Choose the desired Datastore
	* Click **Next**. 

	IF you are using vSAN, select the vSAN datastore. If you are using a dedicated disk, select **Thin Provision**. For more information about disk formats, see [vSphere Virtual Disk Types](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/disk-format.html) in the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) documentation.

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Ops Manager requires a VM with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>

    <%= image_tag("common/images/vsphere/om-deploy-vsphere-04.png") %>

1. At the **Select Networks** screen, select the standard **VM Network**, and click **Next**.

    <%= image_tag("common/images/vsphere/om-deploy-vsphere-05.png") %>

1. At the **Customize template** screen, enter the following information, and click **Next**.
   * **IP Address**: The IP address of the Ops Manager network interface. For example, `10.0.0.2`.
   * **Netmask**: The network mask for Ops Manager. For example, `255.255.255.0`.
   * **Default Gateway**: The default gateway for Ops Manager to use. For example, `10.0.0.1`.
   * **DNS**: One or more DNS servers for the Ops Manager VM to use. For example, `10.20.20.1`.
   * **NTP Servers**: The IP address of one or more NTP servers for Ops Manager. For example, `10.113.60.176`.
   * **Admin Password**: A default password for the `ubuntu` user. If you do not enter a password, Ops Manager will not boot.
   * **Public SSH Key**: (Optional) Enter pre-existing public SSH key value to allow SSH access to the Ops Manager VM.
   * **Custom hostname**: The hostname for the Ops Manager VM. For example, `ops-manager`.

1. Use the **Recent Tasks** panel at the bottom of the vCenter dashboard to check the progress of the OVA import and deployment.

	If the import or deployment is unsuccessful, check the configuration for errors. Fix any errors and redo the deploment process.

## <a id="deploy"></a> Start Ops Manager

1. Create a DNS entry for the IP address that you used for Ops Manager. 

	You must use this fully qualified domain name when you log into Ops Manager.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager security features require you to create a fully qualified domain name to access Ops Manager during the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/customizing/vsphere.html#paas">initial configuration.</a></p>

1. Select the Ops Manager VM and click **Actions** > **Power** > **Power On**. 

	Once the VM boots, the Ops Manager web interface is available at the IP address you specified.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: It is normal to experience a brief delay before the interface is accessible while the web server and VM start up.</p>

1. Navigate to the fully qualified domain of your Ops Manager in a web browser.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: It is normal to experience a brief delay before the interface is accessible while the web server and VM start up.</p>

## <a id="set-up"></a> Set Up Ops Manager Authentication

1. When Ops Manager starts for the first time, you must choose one of the following:
    * [Internal Authentication](#internal): If you use Internal Authentication, PCF maintains your user database.
    * [SAML Identity Provider](#saml): If you use a SAML Identity Provider (IdP), an external identity server maintains your user database.
    * [LDAP Server](#ldap): If you use a LDAP Server, an external identity server maintains your user database.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/select-authentication.png") %>

### <a id='internal'></a> Internal Authentication

1. Select **Internal Authentication** and provide the following information:
   * **Username**, **Password**, and **Password confirmation** to create an Admin user.
   * **Decryption passphrase** and the **Decryption passphrase confirmation**. This passphrase encrypts the Ops Manager datastore, and is not recoverable.
   * **HTTP proxy** or **HTTPS proxy**, follow the instructions in [Configuring Proxy Settings for the BOSH CPI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/pcf-director-proxy-settings.html).
   * Read the **End User License Agreement**, and select the checkbox to accept the terms.
   * Click **Setup Authentication**. It will take a few minutes to initialize the database.
