This topic describes how to configure the BOSH Director tile within <%= vars.ops_manager %> on Azure after [Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> on Azure](./deploy-manual.html).


## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

See the following sections to prepare for configuring BOSH Director on Azure.

### <a id="general-prereqs"></a> General Prerequisites

Before you perform the procedures in this topic, you must have completed the procedures in the following topics:

* [Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on Azure](prepare-env-manual.html)
* [Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> on Azure](deploy-manual.html)

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. For more information, see <a href="../install/ops-man-api.html">Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API</a>.</p>

### <a id="stack-gov-prereqs"></a> Prerequisites for Azure Stack or Azure Government Cloud

If you use Azure Government Cloud, you must set custom VM types for a successful deployment. You can set custom VM types with the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. For more information, see [Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API](../install/ops-man-api.html).

Example `curl` command to set a VM types:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -k https://YOUR-OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/vm_types -X
PUT -H "Authorization: bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
"Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"vm_types":[
{"name": "Standard_D1_v2", "ram": 3584, "cpu": 1, "ephemeral_disk": 51200 },
{"name": "Standard_D2_v2", "ram": 7168, "cpu": 2, "ephemeral_disk": 102400 },
{"name": "Standard_D3_v2", "ram": 14336, "cpu": 4, "ephemeral_disk": 204800 },
{"name": "Standard_D4_v2", "ram": 28672, "cpu": 8, "ephemeral_disk": 409600 },
{"name": "Standard_D5_v2", "ram": 57344, "cpu": 8, "ephemeral_disk": 819200 },
{"name": "Standard_D11_v2", "ram": 14336, "cpu": 2, "ephemeral_disk": 102400 },
{"name": "Standard_D12_v2", "ram": 28672, "cpu": 4, "ephemeral_disk": 204800 },
{"name": "Standard_D13_v2", "ram": 57344, "cpu": 8, "ephemeral_disk": 409600 },
{"name": "Standard_D14_v2", "ram": 114688, "cpu": 16, "ephemeral_disk": 819200 },
{"name": "Standard_F1", "ram": 2048, "cpu": 1, "ephemeral_disk": 16384 },
{"name": "Standard_F2", "ram": 4096, "cpu": 2, "ephemeral_disk": 32768 },
{"name": "Standard_F4", "ram": 8192, "cpu": 4, "ephemeral_disk": 65536 },
{"name": "Standard_F8", "ram": 16384, "cpu": 8,  "ephemeral_disk": 131072}]}'
</pre>

To verify that you have successfully set your custom VM types, use the `GET /api/v0/vm_types` Ops
Manager API endpoint.
