For **Certificate Duration Overrides**, you can choose whether certificates generated within <%= vars.ops_manager %> and CredHub use the default duration specified for the certificate or a custom duration value that you specify.

    ![alt-text="Three fields: the On-Off option for the feature, CA Certificate Duration (days) text field, and Leaf Certificate Duration (days)."](../common/images/duration-overrides.png)

    * **Off:** Select this option to use default duration for certificates created by all products.
    * **On:** Select this option to set a value to override the duration for certificates created by all products. If a product creates a certificate with a longer duration than the value you set, then the longer duration is used.

        1. **CA Certificate Duration (days):** Enter the number of days for which CA certificates are valid.
        2. **Leaf Certificate Duration (days):** Enter the number of days for which leaf certificates are valid. This value must be less than or equal to the CA certificate duration.

        <p> After you set a certificate duration override, you must take additional steps to apply the setting to all certificates. For more information, see <a href="../security/pcf-infrastructure/configure-certificate-duration-overrides.html">Overriding Duration for Certificates</a>.</p>
