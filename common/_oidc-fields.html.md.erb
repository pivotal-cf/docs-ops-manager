1. In your OIDC Provider, create a new Client that will be used for authentication by <%= vars.ops_manager %>
   * Configure the "Grant Type" to be "Authorization Code"
   * Register `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/uaa/login/callback/oidc` as a valid `redirect_uri` for the client
   * If you plan to use OIDC authentication for the BOSH cli, also add `https://BOSH-FQDN-OR-IP:8443/uaa/login/callback/oidc` as a valid `redirect_uri` for the client. If you intend to use the BOSH FQDN, you will need to configure the that later in the Director Config

1. For **Discovery URL**, enter the URL that points to your OIDC service provider discovery URL.

1. For **Client ID**, enter the "Client ID" created in step 1

1. For **Client Secret**, enter the "Client Secret" created in step 1

1. For **Scopes**, enter the scopes to request from the OIDC provider as a comma separated list. The scope of `openid` is required as well as a scope that will allow access to the group claim. Standard scopes of `email` and `profile` may be needed if you plan to use the Claims below to populate common fields in UAA

1. The claims are used to populate the UAA user store with data from the OIDC provider. Only the External Groups Claim is required.
   * Enter the **Username Claim** to populate the `username` field in UAA. <%= vars.ops_manager %> uses this to show the currently logged in user.
   * Enter the **External Groups Claim** to populate the user's associated groups in UAA. Only the provided OIDC Admin Group Name and the default group names of `opsman.full_control`, `opsman.restricted_control`, `opsman.full_view` and `opsman.restricted_view` will be mapped to UAA groups.

1. For **OIDC Admin Group Name**, enter the group name within the OIDC provider that corresponds to users that should have admin access. Users in this OIDC group will be granted the `opsman.admin` scope in UAA.
