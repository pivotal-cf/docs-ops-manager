1. In your OIDC provider, create a new client for <%= vars.ops_manager %> to use for authentication.

  * For "Grant Type", select "Authorization Code".
  * Register `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/uaa/login/callback/oidc` as a valid `redirect_uri` for the client.
  * If you plan to use OIDC authentication for the BOSH CLI, register `https://BOSH-FQDN-OR-IP:8443/uaa/login/callback/oidc` as a valid `redirect_uri` for the client. If you intend to use the BOSH FQDN, you must configure that later in the BOSH Director configuration.

1. For **Discovery URL**, enter your OIDC service provider discovery URL.

1. For **Client ID**, enter the "Client ID" created in Step 1.

1. For **Client Secret**, enter the "Client Secret" created in Step 1.

1. For **Scopes**, enter the scopes to request from the OIDC provider as a comma-separated list. You must include the following scopes.

  * The `openid` scope
  * A scope that allows access to the group claim
  * Standard `email` and `profile` scopes, if you plan to use the claims listed in the next step to populate common fields in UAA

1. Enter the claims used to populate the UAA user store with data from the OIDC provider.
   * Enter the **External Groups Claim** to populate associated groups for the user in UAA. Only the provided OIDC Admin Group Name and the default group names of `opsman.full_control`, `opsman.restricted_control`, `opsman.full_view` and `opsman.restricted_view` are mapped to UAA groups.
   * (Optional) Enter the **Username Claim** to populate the `username` field in UAA. <%= vars.ops_manager %> uses this to show the current logged-in user.

1. For **OIDC Admin Group Name**, enter the OIDC provider group name that corresponds to users who receive admin access. Users in this OIDC group are granted the `opsman.admin` scope in UAA.
