title: Managing errands in your Tanzu Operations Manager deployment
owner: Ops Manager

Errands are scripts that can run at the beginning and at the end of an
installed product's availability time.

This topic describes the product
errands used in <%= vars.ops_manager_first %>, and how you can use <%= vars.ops_manager %> to adjust whether and when these errands run.

Product tiles include two types of errands:

* **Post-deploy errands** run after the product installs but before <%= vars.ops_manager %> makes the product available for use. One example is an errand that publishes a newly-installed service to the Services Marketplace.

* **Pre-delete errands** run after an operator chooses to delete the product but before <%= vars.ops_manager %> actually deletes it. One example is a clean-up task that removes all data objects used by the errand.

When you click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, BOSH either creates a VM for each errand that runs or co-locates errands on existing VMs. Tile developers determine where BOSH deploys the errands for their product.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> provides several post-deploy errands including smoke tests, Apps Manager, notification, <%= vars.ops_manager %> Account, and autoscaling errands. For more information about <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> errands, see the [<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/5.0/tas-for-vms/config-errands.html).

For information about the errands associated with any other <%= vars.ops_manager %> product, see the documentation provided with the product tile.

## <a id='rules'></a> Errand run rules

You can configure two different run rules for errands: **On** and **Off**. These rules control when <%= vars.ops_manager %> executes the errand.

When the errand is configured to be **On**, then it always runs, even if there are no changes to the product manifest. When the errand is configured to be **Off**, it never runs.

### <a id='defaults'></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> defaults and tile defaults

By default, <%= vars.ops_manager %> applies the **On** rule to all  errands.

For any errand, you can override these <%= vars.ops_manager %> defaults with your own tile-specific defaults
defined in the tile [property blueprints](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tile-Developer-Guide/3.0/tile-dev-guide/property-template-references.html#property-blueprints).

## <a id='modify'></a> Configure run rules in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

You can configure the run rules for errands in two places in <%= vars.ops_manager %>. The [Errands](#errands-pane) pane saves your configuration and applies the configuration to future installations. The [Pending Changes](#changes-view) view applies the rules only to the next time you run an <%= vars.ops_manager %> install, without saving them.

### <a id='errands-pane'></a> Errands pane: persistent rules

Product tiles for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and other <%= vars.ops_manager %> products have an **Errands** pane that configures the run rules for the product's errands and saves the settings for later.

The **Errands** pane lists all errands for the product and lets you select **On** or **Off**. The [default](#defaults) option differs depending on the errand, and reflects the default setting used by <%= vars.ops_manager %> for the errand or any tile-specific default that overrides it.

To configure run rules for a tile:

1. Go to <%= vars.ops_manager %> and click the tile to open it.

2. Under the **Settings** tab, open the **Errands** pane.

3. Use the drop-down menus to configure the run rule choice for each errand: **On** or **Off**.

4. Click **Save** to save the configuration values and return to the Installation Dashboard.

5. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** to redeploy the tile with the new settings.

### <a id='changes-view'></a> Review Pending Changes: one-time rules

<%= vars.ops_manager %> lets you quickly configure one-time errand run rules for any product queued up for installation:

1. Go to <%= vars.ops_manager %> **Review Pending Changes** section that shows products
that <%= vars.ops_manager %> has yet to install or update.

1. Expand the **ERRANDS** link, for the product you want to configure. A list of errands associated
with the product appears.

1.  Configure whether an errand runs during the **Apply Changes** action using the check boxes next to
the errand. <%= vars.ops_manager %> uses these settings when
you **Apply Changes** to install the product, but does not save the settings for future installations.

2. Click **Apply Changes** to redeploy the tile.
