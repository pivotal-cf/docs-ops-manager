title: Managing errands in your Tanzu Operations Manager deployment

Errands are scripts that can run at the beginning and at the end of an
installed product's availability time.

This topic describes the product
errands used in <%= vars.ops_manager_first %>, and how you can use <%= vars.ops_manager %> to adjust whether and when these errands run.

Product tiles include two types of errands:

* **Post-deploy errands** run after the product installs but before <%= vars.ops_manager %> makes the product available for use. One example is an errand that publishes a newly-installed service to the Services Marketplace.

* **Pre-delete errands** run after an operator chooses to delete the product but before <%= vars.ops_manager %> actually deletes it. One example is a clean-up task that removes all data objects used by the errand.

When you click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** in <%= vars.ops_manager %>, BOSH either creates a VM for each errand that runs or co-locates errands on existing VMs. Tile developers determine where BOSH deploys the errands for their product.

<%= vars.app_runtime_first %> provides several post-deploy errands including smoke tests, Apps Manager, notification, <%= vars.ops_manager %> Account, and autoscaling errands. For more information about <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> errands, see [Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/3.0/tas-for-vms/configure-pas.html).

For information about the errands associated with any other <%= vars.ops_manager %> product, see the documentation provided with the product tile.

## <a id='rules'></a> Errand run rules

Operators can configure two different run rules for errands: **On** and **Off**. These rules control when <%= vars.ops_manager %> executes the errand.

When the errand is configured to be **On**, then it always runs, even if there are no changes to the product manifest. When the errand is configured to be **Off**, it never runs.

### <a id='defaults'></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> defaults and tile defaults

By default, <%= vars.ops_manager %> applies the **On** rule to all  errands.

For any errand, you can override these <%= vars.ops_manager %> defaults with your own tile-specific defaults
defined in the tile [property blueprints](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tile-Developer-Guide/3.0/tile-dev-guide/property-template-references.html#property-blueprints).

## <a id='modify'></a> Configure run rules in <%= vars.ops_manager %>

You can configure the run rules for errands in two places in <%= vars.ops_manager %>. The [Errands](#errands-pane) pane saves your configuration and applies the configuration to future installations. The [Pending Changes](#changes-view) view applies the rules only to the next time you run an <%= vars.ops_manager %> install, without saving them.

### <a id='errands-pane'></a> Errands pane: persistent rules

Product tiles for <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and other <%= vars.ops_manager %> products have an **Errands** pane that configures the run rules for the product's errands and saves the settings for later.

The **Errands** pane lists all errands for the product and lets you select **On** or **Off**. The [default](#defaults) option differs depending on the errand, and reflects the default setting used by <%= vars.ops_manager %> for the errand or any tile-specific default that overrides it.

To configure the run rules for a tile:

1. Go to <%= vars.ops_manager %> and click the tile to open it.

2. Under the **Settings** tab, open the **Errands** pane.

3. Use the drop-down menus to configure the run rule choice for each errand: **On** or **Off**.

4. Click **Save** to save the configuration values and return to the Installation Dashboard.

5. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** to redeploy the tile with the new settings.

### <a id='changes-view'></a> Review Pending Changes: one-time rules

<%= vars.ops_manager %> lets you quickly configure one-time errand run rules for any product queued up for installation:

1. Go to <%= vars.ops_manager %>. The **Review Pending Changes** section that shows products
that <%= vars.ops_manager %> has yet to install or update.

1. Expand the **ERRANDS** link for the product you want to configure. A list of errands associated with the product appears.

1. Configure whether an errand will be run during **Apply Changes** using the checkboxes next to the errand. <%= vars.ops_manager %> uses these settings when you run **Apply Changes** to install the product, but does not save the settings for future installations.

2. Click **Apply Changes** to redeploy the tile.
