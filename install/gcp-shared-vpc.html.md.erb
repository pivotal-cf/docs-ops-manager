title: Configuring a shared VPC on GCP with Ops Manager
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic describes how you can configure and integrate a shared Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with <%= vars.ops_manager_first %>.

GCP Shared VPC, formerly known as Google Cross-Project Networking (XPN), enables you to assign GCP resources to individual projects within an organization but allows communication and shared services between projects. For more information about shared VPCs, see the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc).

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

To configure a shared VPC, you must assign your project to a Cloud Organization. Confirm that you have a Cloud Organization associated with your GCP account using one of these methods:

* **GCP Console:** From the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), click the **Organization** drop-down menu to display all organizations you belong to.

* **gcloud Command Line Interface (CLI):** From the command line, run `gcloud organizations list` to display all organizations you belong to. To install the gcloud CLI, see [gcloud Overview](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) in the Google documentation.

For more information, see [Creating and Managing Organizations](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id) in the GCP documentation. If you do not have a Cloud Organization, contact GCP support.


## <a id='provision'></a> Step 1: Provision the shared VPC

Follow the procedure in [Enabling a shared VPC host project](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/shared-vpc/provisioning-shared-vpc#enable-shared-vpc-host) in the GCP documentation. This procedure requires shared VPC admin permissions.


## <a id='network'></a> Step 2: Create a shared VPC network

Follow the procedures in [Preparing to Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %> on GCP](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html) to create a new network with firewall rules. Then follow the procedures in:

* [Step 3: Create a GCP Network with Subnet](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#create_network)

* [Step 5: Create Firewall Rules for the Network](../gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#firewall_rules)


## <a id='shared'></a> Step 3: Connect the shared VPC to <%= vars.ops_manager %>

You can use the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) or the gcloud CLI to connect the shared VPC host project with <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

For more information, see [VPC Network Peering](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/peering-networks) in the GCP documentation.

### <a id='shared-gui'></a> Set up VPC network peering with the GCP console

To set up VPC network peering with the GCP console:

1. From the GCP console, click **Networking**, then **VPC network peering**.

    ![alt-text=""](images/vpc-networks.png)

2. Click **Create Connection**.

2. Enter a name for the network connection from the <%= vars.ops_manager %> project to the new shared network, such as `opsmanager-to-xpn`.

    ![alt-text=""](images/om-to-vpc.png)

2. Click **Save**.

3. Click **Create Connection**.

4. Enter a name for the network connection from the new shared network to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> project, such as `xpn-to-opsmanager`.

5. Click **Save**.

### <a id='shared-cli'></a> Set up VPC network peering with the gcloud CLI

To set up VPC network peering with the gcloud CLI:

1. Run:

    ```
    gcloud config set project OPSMANAGER-PROJECT
    ```

    Where `OPSMANAGER-PROJECT` is the name of the project that contains your <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation.

1. To create a connection from the <%= vars.ops_manager %> project to the new shared VPC project, run:

    ```
    gcloud beta compute networks peerings create OPSMANAGER-TO-VPC \
           --network OPSMANAGER-NETWORK \
           --peer-project VPC-HOST-PROJECT \
           --peer-network VPC-NETWORK \
           --auto-create-routes
    ```

    Where:

    * `OPSMANAGER-TO-VPC` is a name you choose for the connection, such as `om-to-vpc`.
    * `OPSMANAGER-NETWORK` is the name of the network assigned to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> project in GCP, such as `my-om-project`.
    * `VPC-HOST-PROJECT` is the name you gave the shared VPC project in [Step 1: Provision the Shared VPC](#provision).
    * `VPC-NETWORK` is the name of the network you gave the shared VPC project in [Step 2: Create Shared VPC Networks](#network).

1. Run:

    ```
    gcloud config set project VPC-HOST-PROJECT
    ```

    Where `VPC-HOST-PROJECT` is the new shared VPC project you created in [Step 1: Provision the Shared VPC](#provision).

1. To create a connection from the new shared VPC project to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> project, run:

    ```
    gcloud beta compute networks peerings create VPC-TO-OPSMANAGER \
           --network VPC-NETWORK \
           --peer-project OPSMANAGER-PROJECT \
           --peer-network OPSMANAGER-NETWORK \
           --auto-create-routes
    ```

    Where:

    * `VPC-TO-OPSMANAGER` is a name you choose for the connection, such as `vpc-to-om`.
    * `VPC-NETWORK` is the name of the network you gave the shared VPC project in [Step 2: Create Shared VPC Networks](#network).
    * `OPSMANAGER-PROJECT` is the name of the project that contains your <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation.
    * `OPSMANAGER-NETWORK` is the name of the network assigned to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> project in GCP.


## <a id='verify'></a> Step 4: Verify the shared VPC configuration

After you configure a shared VPC, use the following procedure to verify that the shared VPC host project VM appears in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> project.

1. From the GCP console, select the <%= vars.ops_manager %> project from the drop-down menu at the top of the page.

1. Click **Networking**, then **VPC networks**.

    ![alt-text=""](images/vpc-networks.png)

2. Confirm that the shared VPC network name appears in the **Subnets** list.

2. Confirm that the shared VPC network **IP address ranges** match what you set for the new VPC project in [Step 2: Create a Shared VPC Network](#network).
