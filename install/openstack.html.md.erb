You can install <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> on OpenStack with <%= vars.app_runtime_first %>. OpenStack is a
cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center.

## <a id='requirements'></a> Requirements

This section describes the requirements for installing <%= vars.ops_manager %> on OpenStack, including general requirements for installing <%= vars.ops_manager %> with <%= vars.ops_manager %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> as well as OpenStack requirements.

<p> You can install <%= vars.ops_manager %> on OpenStack with the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> runtime. The <%= vars.k8s_runtime_first %> runtime is not supported for OpenStack.

For more information about <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>,
see <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/<%= vars.dot_major_tas_version %>/tas-for-vms/architecture-index.html"><%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Components</a>.

For more information about <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>,
see [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated-Edition/1.17/tkgi/GUID-index.html).</p>

### <a id='general'></a> General resource requirements

For <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>-specific resource requirements,
see [<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Resource Requirements](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/<%= vars.dot_major_tas_version %>/tas-for-vms/requirements.html).

### <a id='openstack'></a> OpenStack requirements

The following are OpenStack requirements for deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %>:

* <%= vars.ops_manager %> is supported on all supported releases of OpenStack. OpenStack is a collection of inter-operable components and requires general OpenStack expertise to troubleshoot issues that might occur when installing <%= vars.ops_manager %> on particular releases and distributions. To verify that your OpenStack platform is compatible with <%= vars.ops_manager %>, use the OpenStack Validator tool. For information about the OpenStack Validator tool, see the [CF OpenStack Validator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/cf-openstack-validator) repository on GitHub.

* <%= vars.company_name %> recommends granting complete access to the OpenStack logs to the operator managing the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation process.

* For OpenStack accounts for <%= vars.ops_manager %>, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends following the principle of least privilege by scoping privileges to the most restrictive permissions possible for a given role.

* You must have a dedicated OpenStack project, formerly known as an OpenStack tenant.

* You must have Keystone access to the dedicated OpenStack project, including the following:
  * Auth URL
  * Username and password. The `PrimaryProject` for the user must be the project you want to use to deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For more information, see [Manage projects and users](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/rocky/admin/manage-projects-and-users.html) in the OpenStack documentation.
  * Project name
  * Region (with multiple availability zones if you require high availability)
  * SSL certificate for your wildcard domain

* You must have the ability to do the following in OpenStack:
  * Create and modify VM flavors
  * Enable DHCP if required
  * Create a network and then connect that network with a router to an external network
  * Create an external network with a pool of floating IP addresses
  * Boot VMs directly from image
  * Create two wildcard domains for separate system and app domains

* The following are resource requirements for the dedicated OpenStack project:
  * 118&nbsp;GB of RAM
  * 22 available instances
  * 14 small VMs (1 vCPU, 1024&nbsp;MB of RAM, 10&nbsp;GB of root disk)
  * 2 high-CPU VMs (2 vCPU, 1024&nbsp;MB of RAM, 10&nbsp;GB of root disk)
  * 3 large VMs (4 vCPU, 16384&nbsp;MB of RAM, 10&nbsp;GB of root disk)
  * 3 extra-large VMs (8 vCPU, 16&nbsp;GB of RAM, 160&nbsp;GB of ephemeral disk)
  * 58 vCPUs
  * 1&nbsp;TB of storage
  * Nova or Neutron networking with floating IP support

      <p> By default, <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deploys the number of VM instances required to run a highly available configuration of <%= vars.ops_manager %>. If you are deploying a test or sandbox <%= vars.ops_manager %> that does not require HA, then you can scale down the number of instances in your deployment. For information about the number of instances required to run a minimal, non-HA <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment,
      see <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/<%= vars.dot_major_tas_version %>/tas-for-vms/scaling-ert-components.html">Scaling <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %></a>.</p>

* The following are requirements for the OpenStack Cinder back end:
  * <%= vars.ops_manager %> requires RAW root disk images. The Cinder back end for your OpenStack project must support RAW.
  * <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you use a Cinder back end that supports snapshots. This is required for some BOSH functionalities.
  * <%= vars.company_name %> recommends enabling your Cinder back end to delete block storage asynchronously. If this is not possible, it must be able to delete multiple 20&nbsp;GB volumes within 300 seconds.

* The following are requirements for using an Overlay Network with VXLAN or GRE Protocols:
  * If an overlay network is being used with VXLAN or GRE protocols, the MTU of the created VMs must be adjusted to the best practices recommended by the plugin vendor (if any).
  * DHCP must be enabled in the internal network for the MTU to be assigned to the VMs automatically.
  * To adjust your MTU values, see [Configure Networking](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/<%= vars.dot_major_tas_version %>/tas-for-vms/configure-pas.html) in _Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.
  * Failure to configure your overlay network correctly could cause Apps Manager to fail since applications are not be able to connect to the UAA.

  <p> If you are using IPsec, your resource usage increases by approximately 36&nbsp;bytes. For details, including information about setting correct MTU values, see <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/IPsec-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.9/documentation/GUID-installing.html"> Installing IPsec</a> in the IPsec documentation.</p>


## <a id='outputs'></a> Install <%= vars.ops_manager %> on OpenStack with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>

To install <%= vars.ops_manager %> on OpenStack with the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> runtime:

1. Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %>. For more information, see [Deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> on OpenStack](../openstack/setup.html).

1. Configure BOSH Director on OpenStack. For more information, see [Configuring BOSH Director on OpenStack](../openstack/config.html).

## <a id='next'></a> Next steps

After completing the procedures above, configure a runtime.

For information about installing and configuring a runtime, see [Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/<%= vars.dot_major_tas_version %>/tas-for-vms/configure-pas.html).
