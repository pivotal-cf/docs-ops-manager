This topic describes how to configure BOSH Director after deploying <%= vars.ops_manager_first %> on OpenStack. Use this topic when [Installing <%= vars.ops_manager %> on OpenStack](../install/openstack.html).

* Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have successfully completed all steps in [Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure](setup.html).

* After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in [Configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/configure-pas.html).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You can also perform the procedures in this topic using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. For more information, see <a href="../install/ops-man-api.html">Using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API</a>.</p>


## <a id='log-in'></a> Step 1: Log Into <%= vars.ops_manager %>

1. In a web browser, navigate to the fully qualified domain you created in the [Create a DNS Entry](setup.html#dns-entry) step of _Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure_.

1. Log into <%= vars.ops_manager %>. To log in, see [Log In to <%= vars.ops_manager %> For the First Time](../login.html#login-first-time).


## <a id='openstack-config'></a> Step 2: OpenStack Configs Page

1. In the left navigation of your OpenStack dashboard, click **Project > Compute > Access & Security**. Select the **API Access** tab.

1. Record the **Service Endpoint** for the **Identity** service. You use this Service Endpoint as the Authentication URL for <%= vars.ops_manager %> in a later step.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/openstack/record-endpoint.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'Access & Security'. Below this header are four tabs labeled, from left to right, 'Security Groups', 'Key Pairs', 'Floating IPs', and 'API Access'. API Access is selected. Below the API Access tab are four rectangular buttons labeled, from left to right, 'Download OpenStack RC File v2.0', 'Download OpenStack RC File v3', 'Download EC2 Credentials', and 'View Credentials'. Below these buttons are two columns labeled 'Service' and 'Service Endpoint'. Under the Service column are thirteen rows labeled, from top to bottom, 'Network', 'S3', 'Cloudformation', 'Object Store', 'Artifact', 'Compute_Legacy', 'Volumev3', 'Compute', 'Image', 'Volumev2', 'Identity', 'Volume', and 'Orchestration'.

1. Select **Enable ICMP checks** to enable ICMP on your networks. <%= vars.ops_manager %> uses ICMP checks to confirm that components within your network are reachable. Review the [Configure Security](setup.html#security) step of _Deploying BOSH and <%= vars.ops_manager %> to OpenStack_ to ensure you have configured ICMP in your Security Group.

1. Use the following steps to create one or more <%= vars.ops_manager %> networks using information from your OpenStack network:
    * Click **Add Network**.
    * Enter a unique **Name** for the network.
    * Click **Add Subnet** to create one or more subnets for the network.
    * For **Network ID**, use the **ID** from the OpenStack page.
    * For **CIDR**, use the **Network Address** from the OpenStack page.
    * For **Reserved IP Ranges**, use the first 10 IP addresses of the **Network Address** range, and the private IP address of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> instance that you recorded in the [Associate a Floating IP Address](setup.html#floating-ip) step of _Provisioning the OpenStack Infrastructure_.
    * For **DNS**, enter one or more Domain Name Servers.
    * For **Gateway**, use the **Gateway IP** from the OpenStack page.
    * For **Availability Zones**, select which Availability Zones to use with the network.
1. Click **Save**.<%= vars.expand_network_azs %>


## <a id='assign-az'></a> Step 7: Assign AZs and Networks Page

1. Select **Assign Availability Zones**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/openstack/assign-az.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the header 'Assign AZs and Networks' with a horizontal line underneath. Below the line are the words 'The BOSH Director is a single instance. Choose the availability zone in which to place that instance. It is highly recommended that you backup this VM on a regular basis to preserve settings.' Below this text is a dropdown labeled 'Singleton Availability Zone', with 'nova' selected. Below this is another dropdown labeled 'Network', with 'loam' selected.") %>

1. From the **Singleton Availability Zone** dropdown, select the availability zone that you created in a previous step. The BOSH Director installs in this Availability Zone.

1. Use the dropdown to select the **Network** that you created in a previous step. BOSH Director installs in this network.

In the top right corner of the image is a blue, rectangular button labeled 'Save'. Below the header are four columns labeled, from left to right, 'Job', 'Instances', 'VM Type', and 'Persistent Disk Type'. Under 'Job' are rows labeled with the names of two VMs, 'BOSH Director' and 'Main Compilation Job'. The 'Main Compilation Job' row is expanded, which reveals a 'Floating IPs' field, with the values '1.1.1.1-1.1.1.2'. Under 'Instances' are two dropdowns, with 'Automatic: 1' for BOSH Director and '1' for Main Compilation Job selected. Under 'VM Type' are two dropdowns, with 'Automatic: m1.large (cpu: 4, ram...' selected for BOSH Director and 'm1.small (cpu: 1, ram: 2 GB...' selected for Main Compilation Job. Under 'Persistent Disk Type' is one dropdown with 'Automatic: 50 GB' selected for BOSH Director and the word 'None' for Main Compilation Job.") %>

1. Adjust any values as necessary for your deployment, such as increasing the persistent disk size. Select **Automatic** from the dropdown to provision the amount of persistent disk predefined by the job. If the persistent disk field reads **None**, the job does not require persistent disk space.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> For the BOSH Director job, select a VM type with at least 8&nbsp;GB memory.</p>
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you set a field to <strong>Automatic</strong> and the recommended resource allocation changes in a future version, <%= vars.ops_manager %> automatically uses the updated recommended allocation.</p>

1. (Optional) To define floating IP addresses for the BOSH Director job:
  1. Select the icon next to the **BOSH Director** job name to see the **FLOATING IPs** field.
  1. Enter a floating IP address range under **FLOATING IPs**. The number of IP addresses in the range that you provide must match the number of job instances.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Click the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard link to return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**. If the following ICMP error message appears, click **Ignore errors and start the install**.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/openstack/icmp-error.png", :alt => "At the top of the image is the rectangular, dark green Ops Manager header, with a teal square containing a capital P on the far left, the words 'Pivotal Ops Manager' to the right of the square, and the words 'pivotal-cf' beside a downward-pointing carat on the far right. Below the header is an error message with a red background. To the left on the error message is a red triangle containing an exclamation point beside the words 'Please review the errors below'. Below 'Please review the errors below' is a bullet list with two items: 'Cannot reach gateway with IP 10.0.16.1 (ignorable if ICMP is deactivated)' and 'Cannot reach DNS with IP 10.0.0.2 (ignorable if ICMP is deactivated)'. To the right of this list are two buttons: a white, rectangular button labeled 'Ignore errors and start the install' in red letters on the left, and a red, rectangular button labeled 'Stop and fix errors' in white letters on the right.") %>

1. BOSH Director installs. The image shows the **Changes Applied** message that <%= vars.ops_manager %> displays when the installation process successfully completes.

    <%= image_tag("../common/images/openstack/om-installed.png", :alt => "A pop-up window with a round, gray X button in the upper-right corner and the words 'Changed Applied' next to a round, green circle containing a checkmark.
