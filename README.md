## How To Use Bookbinder To View Your Documentation

[Bookbinder](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder/blob/master/README.md) is a command-line
utility for stitching Markdown documents into a hostable web app. The documentation team uses
Bookbinder to publish our documentation sites, but you can also use Bookbinder to view a live
version of your documentation on your local machine.

Bookbinder draws the content for the site from this repository, the left navigation menu ("subnav")
from [docs-book-om](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-book-om), and various layout
configuration and assets from [docs-layout-repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-layout-repo).

To use Bookbinder to view your documentation, perform the following steps:

1. Clone this repository to the `~/workspace` directory on your local machine.
1. Clone the following repositories to the `~/workspace` directory on your
local machine:
    * [docs-book-om](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-book-om)
    * [docs-layout-repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-layout-repo)
    * [docs-partials](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partials)
1. Use the **Versions and Branching** table above to determine which branch of `docs-ops-manager` that you need to `git checkout` to build the version of the documentation that you want. If necessary, navigate to the `docs-ops-manager` directory and `git checkout BRANCH-NAME`. 
1. Navigate in the `docs-book-om` directory.
1. Run `bundle install` to install all of the necessary gems, including Bookbinder.
1. Run `bundle exec bookbinder bind local` to build a Rack web-app of the book. After the bind has completed, navigate
into the `final_app` directory and run `rackup`. Then navigate to `localhost:9292/platform/ops-manager/index.html` in a
browser.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

We use Concourse pipelines to provide continuous integration and continuous delivery. Any change made to this repository
or the [https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-book-om](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-book-om) Book repository trigger a
"bind" where the disparate parts of the Ops Manager documentation are assembled into a single web app. A successful bind
triggers pushing the app to the staging site,
[https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/platform/ops-manager](http://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/platform/ops-manager). After
review, the staging site is manually pushed to the production site,
[https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/ops-manager/](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/ops-manager/).

Concourse Pipelines:

* **master**: https://concourse.run.pivotal.io/teams/cf-docs/pipelines/om
* **edge**: https://concourse.run.pivotal.io/teams/cf-docs/pipelines/om?group=edge
