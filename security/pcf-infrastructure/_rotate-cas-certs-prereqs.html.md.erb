Before you rotate certificates:

* You must have <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>.

* You must reset any certificates that were manually set in CredHub on
<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.6 and earlier to prevent them from being rotated with
other certificates generated by CredHub. To find and reset any manually set
certificates in CredHub, see [Reviewing manually set certificates in CredHub](manual-credhub-certificate.html).

If you use <%= vars.k8s_runtime_first %>, rotate your certificates using the instructions in the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> documentation; see [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> Certificates|https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated-Edition/1.18/tkgi/GUID-certificate-concepts.html]. Use the [Advanced certificate rotation with CredHub Maestro](advanced-certificate-rotation.html) instructions for only the certificates that are not rotated by the <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> procedures.

* Your product tile must have one of the following versions installed to rotate
CredHub-managed certificates with the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API:
    * <%= vars.app_runtime %> v2.7.21 or later.
    * <%= vars.app_runtime %> v2.8.2 or later.
    * <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile v2.7.21 or later.
    * <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile v2.8.2 or later.
    * Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime %> v2.7.21 or later.
    * Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime %> v2.8.2 or later.
    * <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.7.17 or later.
    * <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> v2.8.2 or later.

If you have an earlier version of a product tile that was previously listed , use this procedure
to rotate certificates managed only by <%= vars.ops_manager %>. Then,
to rotate certificates managed in CredHub, see [Advanced certificate rotation with CredHub Maestro](advanced-certificate-rotation.html).
